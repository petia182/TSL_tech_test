I focused more on the front end at the beginning.

At the end of the 2 hours I didn't have time to finish the form for sending emails.

I would've used ActionMailer for this purpose and simple_form for the user input, but it takes more time to set up.

Overall:

The log-in form works.
The links for sharing on social media work
Links in the footer also work.
The form for emails work + the option to add multiple emails.

If I was given all the relevant assets maybe it would've taken me around 2 more hours.
