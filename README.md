I focused more on the front end and the beginning.

At the end of the 2 hours I didn't have time to finish the form for sending emails.

I would've used ActionMailer, but it takes a bit more time to set so it can send emails from the user's email.

The log-in form works. The links for sharing on social media work. Link in the footer also work.
